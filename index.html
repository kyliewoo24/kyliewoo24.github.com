<h1> Information for making music </h1>
<p>
Making music is pretty easy! I have made a list for you, answer these questions and see if you can do these things:


<ul>

Can you feel the beat??
Do you know what sharps are??
Are you sure you can read notes??
And finally, the most important question of all
Do you take music seriously??
  
</ul>

</p>

<p>
Well if you don't know the answer to those questions, you should by the time you get to the end of this website!

So please enjoy this website!!!
