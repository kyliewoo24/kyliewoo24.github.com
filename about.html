At the minute all I have told is that I have a best friend who lives in Gummybear Land.
Her name is Jenny Jeanne and she is so nice.
One day I was bored so I decided to create this awesome girl and a place for her to live.
Unfortunatly I couldn't think of one thing, what language they should speak,so all you have to do is think of a made up language and write a word in English then write it in the language of your choice

GOOD LUCK :-)
